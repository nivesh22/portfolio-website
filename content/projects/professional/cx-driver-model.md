Modeled how supply-chain touchpoints (routing accuracy, delivery slot adherence, installation quality, reschedules) influence Net Promoter Score (NPS) for large-appliance orders.

Approach:
- Unified delivery + installation data with customer feedback into a single analysis dataset.
- Trained a driver model with uplift and partial-dependence/sensitivity analysis to quantify controllable levers.
- Produced explainability views by geography and vendor to align ops playbooks and SLAs.

Outcome:
- Prioritized changes to routing and install workflows and projected NPS lift with confidence bands.
